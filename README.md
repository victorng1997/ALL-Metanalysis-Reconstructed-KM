# ALL-Metanalysis-Reconstructed-KM
This repository contains the data reconstructed from the Kaplan-Meier curves by extracting data from the meta-analysis published in XXX, along with the code used to validate the results.

* The CSV file containing the data for Overall Survival (OS) is named *OS.csv*.
* The CSV file containing the data for Relapse-Free Survival/Event-Free Survival (RFS/EFS) is named *EFS_RFS.csv*.
* The R Markdown file used for validating OS data is *Data_validation_OS.rmd*, and the corresponding HTML output is *Data_validation_OS.html*.
* The R Markdown file used for validating RFS/EFS data is *Data_validation_RFS.rmd*, with the HTML output named *Data_validation_RFS.html*.
* In the *curves* folder, you can find all the OS and RFS/EFS curves in PNG format. These images allow you to compare the original curves with the reconstructed ones for validation.
